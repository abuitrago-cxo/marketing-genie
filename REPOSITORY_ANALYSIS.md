- Less mature ecosystem compared to others

## Recommendation: Hybrid Architecture

### Primary Foundation: Current LangGraph Project

**Rationale:**
1. **Established Infrastructure**: Already set up in your workspace with production-ready deployment
2. **Mature Workflow Engine**: LangGraph provides excellent state management and workflow orchestration
3. **Extensible Design**: Clean modular architecture makes it easy to add new capabilities
4. **Proven Scalability**: Redis/PostgreSQL backend supports enterprise-scale operations

### Integration Strategy: Unified Wrapper Architecture

Create a multi-layered architecture that preserves the current project's strengths while incorporating the best features from the other repositories:
